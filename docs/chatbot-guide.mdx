# AI Book Assistant

This book includes an AI-powered chatbot that can answer questions about the content. Look for the chat bubble in the bottom-right corner of any page.

## How to Use

### General Q&A

1. Click the chat bubble icon in the bottom-right corner
2. Type your question about any topic covered in the book
3. The assistant searches the book content and provides an answer with source references
4. Click on source tags to see which sections informed the answer

**Example questions:**
- "What is ROS 2 and how does it relate to humanoid robotics?"
- "Explain the difference between Gazebo and Unity for simulation"
- "How does NVIDIA Isaac Sim handle physics?"

### Selected-Text Mode

1. Highlight any text on a page (more than 10 characters)
2. A yellow indicator appears in the chat panel showing your selection
3. Ask a question — the assistant answers using **only** the selected text
4. Click "Clear selection" to return to general Q&A mode

This is useful for:
- Getting explanations of specific code snippets
- Clarifying technical paragraphs
- Asking follow-up questions about a particular section

### Chat History

- Your conversation persists across page navigations
- Close and reopen the chat — your messages are still there
- Click the **+** button in the chat header to start a fresh conversation

## Limitations

- **Book content only**: The assistant answers based on the book's content. It cannot answer questions about topics not covered in the book.
- **Response time**: Answers may take a few seconds as the system searches and generates responses.
- **Not a tutor**: The assistant helps you find and understand book content but does not replace hands-on practice or instructor guidance.
- **Context window**: Very long conversations may lose earlier context. Start a new chat if answers become less relevant.

## Privacy

- **No personal data stored**: The system stores only chat messages and session IDs
- **Session-based**: Each chat session is independent — no user accounts or tracking
- **Content stays local**: Your questions are processed to find relevant book sections and generate answers, then stored only for session continuity
